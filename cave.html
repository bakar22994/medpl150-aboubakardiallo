    <p class="outlined-text";>
      Photography is one of my absolute dearest forms of expression.
      One of the ways I use photography is as a way to connect with 
      other people who share similar experiences. When I take 
      photos, I don’t want to just scratch the surface—I want to go
      deeper, doing my absolute best to capture its essence, and in 
      a way that I’m certain my people can understand. The prospect
      of someone looking at one of my images and seeing a part of
      themselves in it, even if they don’t know my exact story,
      is one of my greatest pleasures. Photography allows me to
      communicate sentiments that can’t adequately be explained 
      through words alone.
    </p>

      Creativity also plays a huge role in how I make photos. 
      Photography is the most accessible it’s ever been; more 
      people than ever around the world have a camera right 
      in their pocket. So, I feel extra motivated to push 
      myself creatively. I like to experiment with angles, 
      exposure, flash, subject matter, and other tools; I 
      want my images to stand out. I enjoy trying new ideas
      and taking risks, even if the execution isn’t always 
      the best.

      When I swapped phones with my brother earlier this year, 
      I got a creative awakening. I took thousands of photos 
      on my iPhone 15 Pro just this year alone (note: do NOT 
      upgrade your iPhone every year, they are built off slave
      minerals to say the least). I got a sudden urge to take 
      frequent walks throughout the city, whether it was down 
      5th Avenue in Midtown, Riverside Drive in Harlem, or in 
      Washington Square Park. My "Fortwo" image, along with the
      very background of this website, was actually shot by me 
      at Riverside back in November. I loved testing my 
      photography skills in the many environments I came 
      across.

      As I continue working on projects throughout the semester,
      each project is a chance for me to improve and build on 
      what I previously learned. I hope to reach a point where 
      my technical skills are unmistakable in my work. Showing 
      a high level of skill and effort is also important to me 
      because it reflects growth and dedication. I want to get 
      to a point where I’m confident in my abilities and I can 
      use photography to the highest degree of expertise.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="outlined-text";>
      I also like to incorporate satire into my work to some 
      extent. I like to keep it real and make people laugh; 
      using irony in the things that I make allows me to comment
      on personal or social experiences without being too 
      serious or direct. To be honest, I think that things don’t
      always have to be that deep. Being a tad unserious makes 
      some of the media I make more layered.  Depending on what 
      I make, people have the option to engage with my work on 
      different levels, depending on how closely they look.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="outlined-text";>
      All in all, I’m drawn to themes of shared experience, 
      identity, and emotion. Photography has the power to freeze
      moments that reflect larger ideas about society. This is 
      all too important, especially in a time when people are 
      “chronically online”, constantly scrolling and interacting 
      with others on social media instead of interacting with
      the world around them. My photography skills are something
      I see as constantly evolving for me. Each photo I take 
      helps me learn more about my style and what I want to 
      communicate. I truly want to create work that feels 
      meaningful. Not only to me, but also to the people who
      find my work and hopefully learn to love it. I want to 
      continue my growth as a creator of media and to continue 
      using photography as a way to reflect both my personal 
      experiences and the world around me.
