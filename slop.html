    <h1>"AI Slop" - Response</h1>

    <p class="outlined-text";>
      Nesrine Malik’s article highlights the issue of “AI slop”. She stresses that it is spreading rapidly throughout the world, putting deep dents in the way that people perceive reality, politics, and media in general. AI slop is low effort, AI-generated visual content. It is on the rise due to the development of a new informational ecosystem that prioritizes efficiency and profit over accuracy, meaning, and actual nuance. But the threat of media produced by artificial intelligence isn’t just that it misleads people. Its sheer volume and ability to attract engagement are also extremely concerning precedents for what may be to come.

      One of the most significant observations by Malik in the article is flooding of AI-generated images into authentic ones. Although AI slop tends to poorly hide its lack of authenticity—insinuated by its name—there are numerous examples that are realistic enough to pass as actual, legitimate information to a great number of people. This is especially evident in media communicated via WhatsApp, Facebook, and other platforms consisting of older individuals who are among the most vulnerable. Slop produced by artificial intelligence preys on those who lack knowledge and understanding of technology, and by extension, how advanced artificial intelligence has become. And as AI slop continues spreading and advancing, the line between legitimate and inauthentic information blurs more and more.

      Malik also talks about how social media companies also enable the use of AI slop; they are significant beneficiaries of content that is cheap to produce and effective at provoking attention. Users are more inclined to scroll, react, and share, regardless of whether or not the content is meaningless or misleading. Social media algorithms contribute directly to this as well; they learn precisely what provokes said attention and feed users more of it. Speaking personally as a “chronically online” social media user, I constantly come into contact with content that I have doubts about. Twitter (not calling it “X”), upon the shift in ownership to a Dutch billionaire, saw a significant increase in bots who flood timelines with utter nonsense. This is particularly distressing for users, as they have to constantly discern what’s real and what’s fake—sometimes, unfortunately, ostracizing actual people in the process.

    <p class="outlined-text";>
      Another significant observation of Malik is the political use of AI-generated content. AI removes many of the traditional barriers to producing propaganda: there are no real people involved, no physical constraints, and with the efficiency of AI-generative tools, the cost of production is significantly reduced. This allows for a sea of endless fictional scenarios that reinforce rather delusional ideological beliefs—primarily on the political right. For example, AI-generated images are  frequently used to romanticize conservative values and appeal to conservative ideas of “nostalgia”. This includes, but is not limited to the submissive and obedient “trad-wife”, alongside, for some reason, white, blond families. This use of artificial intelligence trains it on existing inequalities and dominant cultural norms, further increasing its danger.

    <p class="outlined-text";>
      Honestly, Malik’s article was incredibly informative and reinforced previous concerns I have had with AI—especially due to my personal experiences with it. Artificial intelligence is a serious danger to the integrity of the internet, and overall, the entirety of the media that we consume daily.
