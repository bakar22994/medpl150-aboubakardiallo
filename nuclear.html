    <h1>"The Rising Risk and How We Stop It" - Response</h1>

    <p class="outlined-text";>
      W.J. Hennigan’s New York Times article "The Rising Risk and How We Stop It" is about the dangers of nuclear warfare, as well as the risks that have recently been reignited through growing tensions. Hennigan argues that nuclear weapons are once more at risk of being resorted to by global powers, particularly in the context of the war in Ukraine, and that this shift poses a risk not only to the political landscape of the world but also to the millions upon millions of lives that inhabit it.

      One of the most significant parts of this article is Hennigan’s effort to emphasize the effects of nuclear war. Hennigan narrates in graphic, compelling detail the physical and human effects of nuclear weapons. For instance, he describes how even the smallest of them could devastate civilian populations, infrastructure, and ecosystems, accompanied by large graphical illustrations of shells, explosions, and cars flying in the background, encapsulating the mayhem. The various techniques that he uses capture the gruesomeness of it all in an unsettling, yet captivating manner.

      Hennigan eventually shifts to the frailty of nuclear deterrence; while it is argued that deterrence has prevented nuclear war in the past, Hennigan suggests that it's not sustainable down the road. He uses the onset of war between Russia and Ukraine as an example of this. The environment is transitioning to a state of extreme volatility with the increasing number of nuclear-armed states, modernization of arsenals, and collapse of arms control agreements.

      Another significant issue that Hennigan brings attention to is the decline of arms control and negligence in communication between world powers. He describes how there have been significant ruptures in international relations; with the suspension of New START treaty and the reduced activity of nuclear risk reduction centers, the likelihood of conflict is the highest it has been in decades. This risk is especially alarming considering the speed and destructive potential of modern nuclear weapons. Hennigan stresses that world leaders must work harder to communicate with each other and prevent conflict. Transparency and dialogue are crucial to patching up these strained relations and preventing the potential catastrophic outcomes that he describes throughout the article.

      Hennigan also takes note of the idea that many of the people alive today never experienced the constant fear of nuclear annihilation during the Cold War. He expands by addressing that this may contribute to the issue of public disengagement and the lack of social action. The article, accounting for this, attempts to reconnect those unfamiliar with the clear, explicit implications of nuclear use. Preventing nuclear war is primarily the responsibility of policymakers, military strategists, and world leaders—however, that does not absolve citizens of their duty to take action. He calls for them to politically engage and hold people in power responsible.

      Hennigan’s choices of design and verbiage within the article was very compelling to me. I think he communicated the message incredibly well that nuclear weapons remain an existential threat; the dangers of nuclear war are not by any means out of the realm of possibility, regardless of how much we pretend that it isn't. We can’t remain complacent.
