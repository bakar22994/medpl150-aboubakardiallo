      This is my second image under Homework #2, titled "Eye of Ba". I basically just cropped out most of my face and slapped on a black and white filter - I also faded it a little to add to the dramatic effect. (Fun fact: I heard of the "Eye of Ra" when I made this but I didn't remember what it looked like at all. It took me aback when I searched it up on Google and I *just so happened* to make it look exactly the same)
