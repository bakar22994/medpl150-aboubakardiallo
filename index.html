      <h1 style="color:purple; align:center;">My name is Aboubakar Diallo.</h1>
      <!-- plan to put this on a completely seperate page, make it more artistic type ish-->
  <br>
  <p>I am Harlem-raised of Fulani African descent, an avid 
  appreciator of sports, music, and fashion, and I am also a junior at Hunter College
  with a concentration in General Media Studies. I am merely a novice in digital design,
  have never built a website, and lack knowledge on how to use Adobe Creative Cloud, but
  I greatly look forward to learning more and applying my own style and flair to what I
  create as I go.</p>
