      This is my first image under Homework #2, titled "Purple Genes". I chose this image because, honestly, I thought I did my thing with this one. I used a photo of Lexington Ave and 68th I took from the Skybridge and basically just slapped a purple tint on it. I also named this after one of my favorite songs - if you know you know. #RealSossholic
