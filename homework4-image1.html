      This is my first image under Homework #4, titled "Natives". I specifically wanted try my hardest for this one with the skills that I had at the time. Not too long before making this, I found a post on Twitter (not calling it X) with an elder Native American man. He was talking about how, growing up, the school he went to didn't allow him to speak his native tongue; every single time he did, he was beaten. Eventually, he ended up losing the ability to speak it entirely. Listening to this, I was able to draw a parallel between Native American colonization by the US and Palestinian colonization by the occupation. Then, I got the idea to make this collage, dedicated to both groups from their rightful, native lands.
