      This is my Homework #7 submission, titled "Fortwo". In the image, there's a Smart Fortwo parked alongside a roadway on Riverside Park in Harlem. I chose this photo because it was one of my favorites out of the one that I took on this November day. I really liked the little car parked in the corner of the image, mixed with the beautiful landscape in the background. In my illustration, I tried my best to make it abstract while keeping the original elements of the photo. But unfortunately, it didn't come out as I hoped at all. It seems very vague and half-baked and I'm sure I could do much better. At the very least, I can certainly say liked the color palette of warm tones that I used.
