      This is my second image under Homework #4, titled "Brainrot". I think the name speaks for itself - and it's also clear that I made it in a time pinch. In one of my reading reflections, I stated that I liked to use satire, and this comes from a more lighthearted and playful note than my "Natives" collage. With a lot of media now seemingly being made to mean absolutely nothing, I wanted to make something that mirrored that. I tried to make it look as much as sensory overload as I could and threw in as much meaningless things as possible for maximum brainrot.
